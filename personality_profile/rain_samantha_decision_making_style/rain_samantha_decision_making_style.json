    "summary": "Your highest score is rational decision-making. This means that you are a rational thinking who evaluates your options before deciding. Your second highest score was for intuition, which shows that you often rely on your instincts, especially in emotional and uncertain situations. Your rational and intuitive scores indicate that you are a balanced decision-maker who relies on logic first, but also considers emotions when relevant. You are independent and proactive, preferring to evaluate options rather than act impulsively. However, you sometimes hesitate when making big choices and occasionally feel pressured by deadlines. You had moderate scores for avoidance and spontaneity, meaning that you occasionally hesitate with big decisions but don't excessively hesitate, and you can make fast decisions when needed but prefer analysis."
